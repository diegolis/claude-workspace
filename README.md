# claude-workspace

A multi-pane terminal grid for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) with automatic session persistence. Run multiple Claude Code instances side by side and pick up exactly where you left off after a restart.

## Features

- **Grid layout** — configurable N×M grid of terminal panes
- **Session persistence** — saves working directory, Claude session ID, virtualenv, and last running program every 60s
- **Auto-resume** — restarts each pane in the right directory, re-activates its virtualenv, and relaunches whatever was running (Claude with `--resume`, or any other program like `htop`, `vim`, etc.)
- **Live titles** — each pane shows its current path, session ID, and Claude's activity
- **Rearrangeable** — click a title to select it, click another to swap them
- **Bell notifications** — when Claude finishes (or any program rings the terminal bell) in a pane you're not looking at, the label blinks orange, the window asks for attention, a desktop notification pops up, and a short sound plays. Click the notification to raise the window and focus that pane's terminal
- **Clickable URLs** — Ctrl+Click a URL in any pane to open it in your default browser
- **System colors** — auto-detects your GNOME terminal font and color palette

## Prerequisites

**Linux only** (GTK 3 + VTE). macOS/Windows support is not available yet — see [#1](https://github.com/diegolis/claude-workspace/issues/1).

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-vte-2.91 gir1.2-notify-0.7 xdg-utils gnome-session-canberra sound-theme-freedesktop
```

- `python3-gi`, `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`, `gir1.2-vte-2.91` — GTK 3 + VTE bindings (required)
- `gir1.2-notify-0.7` — libnotify GIR bindings used for desktop bell notifications with a clickable "focus pane" action (optional; without it the label still blinks but no popup appears). `libnotify-bin` is not required
- `xdg-utils` — provides `xdg-open` for Ctrl+Click URL opening (optional; usually preinstalled)
- `gnome-session-canberra`, `sound-theme-freedesktop` — provide `canberra-gtk-play` and the `message-new-instant` sound used for the bell (optional; without them, notifications are silent)

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) must be installed and available in your PATH.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegolis/claude-workspace.git
cd claude-workspace
make install
```

This installs to `~/.local/bin/` and `~/.local/lib/`. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

To uninstall:

```bash
make uninstall
```

For development, run directly from the repo:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m claude_workspace
```

## Usage

```bash
claude-workspace
```

On first run, a default config is created at `~/.config/claude-workspace/config.json`. Edit it to define your panes.

The number of panes is determined by the `panes` array — add as many as you need. The `columns` value controls the grid layout. For example, 8 panes with 4 columns gives a 4×2 grid:

```json
{
  "columns": 4,
  "panes": [
    {"name": "api-1", "directory": "~/projects/my-api"},
    {"name": "api-2", "directory": "~/projects/my-api"},
    {"name": "api-3", "directory": "~/projects/my-api"},
    {"name": "api-4", "directory": "~/projects/my-api"},
    {"name": "web", "directory": "~/projects/my-web"},
    {"name": "infra", "directory": "~/projects/infra"},
    {"name": "docs", "directory": "~/projects/docs"},
    {"name": "scripts", "directory": "~/projects/scripts"}
  ]
}
```

Multiple panes can point to the same directory — each one maintains its own independent Claude session.

### Skip permissions prompt

By default, Claude asks for permission before running commands. To bypass this, add the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag:

```json
{
  "claude_flags": "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
}
```

### Enabling bell notifications

claude-workspace reacts to the VTE `bell` signal (any `\a` / BEL `0x07` written to the terminal). Claude Code's built-in `"preferredNotifChannel": "terminal_bell"` setting only fires on a narrow set of events (permission prompts, long-running idle timeouts) and in practice rarely emits a BEL during a normal interactive session.

The challenge is deciding *when* to emit the BEL. None of Claude Code's built-in hooks map cleanly to "Claude is done and needs me":

- `Stop` fires on every turn end (intermediate tool calls included) — too noisy if you have long multi-step conversations.
- `Notification` with `idle_prompt` fires after every response too (reported upstream as [#12048](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12048), [#10168](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10168)).
- The `idle_prompt` threshold is hardcoded to 60s (not user-settable at the time of writing).

The least-noisy approximation combines two hooks:

1. **`PreToolUse` with matcher `AskUserQuestion`** — fires when Claude explicitly uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool to pose a structured question.
2. **`Stop` with a script that inspects `last_assistant_message`** — fires the BEL only when the assistant's last text ends with `?` or `¿`, catching plain-text questions that don't go through `AskUserQuestion`.

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "printf '\\a' > /dev/tty"}
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "/home/youruser/.claude/notify-on-question.sh"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

With the companion script (`~/.claude/notify-on-question.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
data=$(cat)
msg=$(echo "$data" | jq -r '.last_assistant_message // empty' 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$msg" ] && exit 0
trimmed=$(printf '%s' "$msg" | sed -E 's/[[:space:]*`_")\]]+$//')
case "$trimmed" in
  *\?) printf '\a' > /dev/tty ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Remember to `chmod +x ~/.claude/notify-on-question.sh`. This still misses the case where Claude finishes a task and waits silently (no question), but trades that for far less noise during long sessions. claude-workspace's `_on_bell` handler additionally suppresses the notification when the pane is focused and the window is active, so you only get notified for panes you're not looking at. Restart your Claude sessions (or the whole app) for hook changes to take effect.

### Configuration reference

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `columns` | `2` | Number of columns in the grid |
| `save_interval` | `60` | Seconds between state saves |
| `claude_flags` | `""` | Extra flags passed to `claude` |
| `font` | `null` | Terminal font (null = auto-detect system monospace font) |
| `background` | `null` | Terminal background color hex (null = `#000000`) |
| `foreground` | `null` | Terminal foreground color hex (null = `#ffffff`) |
| `palette` | `null` | 16-color terminal palette (null = auto-detect from GNOME, fallback to Ubuntu default) |
| `panes` | | Array of `{name, directory}` objects — add as many as you want |

### Keyboard / Mouse

- **Click title** — select pane (highlighted); also clears any pending bell notification on that pane
- **Click another title** — swap the two panes
- **Click same title** — deselect
- **Ctrl+Click on URL** — open in default browser

### State files

- Config: `~/.config/claude-workspace/config.json`
- State: `~/.local/state/claude-workspace/state.json`

## How it works

Each pane spawns a bash shell and runs `claude --resume <session_id>` (or plain `claude` for new sessions). A background timer polls `/proc` every 3 seconds to read each pane's working directory, active virtualenv (`VIRTUAL_ENV`), and currently running child process, and to match it to a Claude session file. State is saved to disk every 60 seconds.

On restart, each pane restores its last directory, re-activates its virtualenv if one was active, and relaunches the program that was running (Claude resumes the conversation; other programs like `htop` or `vim` are re-executed as-is).

Bell notifications use the VTE `bell` signal (triggered by BEL `\a`). When it fires in a pane that isn't focused, the window sets its urgency hint, the pane label starts blinking, libnotify pops a desktop notification (via the Python `Notify` GI binding, with a "default" action wired up), and `canberra-gtk-play` plays the `message-new-instant` sound from the freedesktop theme. Clicking the notification raises the window and grabs focus for that pane's terminal. Focusing the terminal or clicking the label also clears the state.
